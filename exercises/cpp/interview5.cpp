// - You're traveling and there is a set of cities that you can visit.
// - You always travel as part of some tour (you canâ€™t just move to an arbitrary city without being part of a tour).
// - A tour can be done within the same city or take you from one city to another. (only two city in a single tour)
// - A tour can only start in the city in which the last tour ends.
// - Each tour has a quantified Fun value. (This value can be negative)
// - Each tour takes 1 day.

// Given a particular number of days to travel, find the best start city to have the most fun.
